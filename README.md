## Descriptions (by file)
* pythag.cpp - Pythagorean triple game. 
Specify a maximum leg length then put your math skills to the test and go 10 rounds guessing the hypotenuse based on two randomly generated leg values.
The final score is the accumulation of how far you were off from the answer each time. Lower scores are better!
